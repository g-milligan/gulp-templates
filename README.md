# gulp-templates
This is an implementation for deploying gulp project templates. As I create more templates, I will heap them into this repo.

# Templates

One webgl project scaffolding starter template, creatively named "webgl". 

More template folders for different types of projects could easily be added. 
They probably will.

# Project generator

I have a shell script called "gulpinit". Running gulpinit will allow me to select which project template to build.
The "gulpinit" shell script copies template folders into a new project and also lets me know which 
node_modules install commands are required for the individual project.

Once the project is built, running gulp will perform default development operations, such as:

-open the project in a browser tab
-automatically reload the browser when html or js is saved
-live reload the window when css is saved
-compile sass and minify javascript, as needed (configurable in gulpfile.js)

# Setup
