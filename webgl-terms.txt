Vertex
  A point defined in 3 dimensional space. Values are used to
  describe this point. For example, (x,y,z) is used to determine "left", "top",
  "zoom" of one point in 3D space. A matrix can be (x,y,z,x,y,z,x,y,z) to
  determine a shape with three points, or vertices.
Matrix
  A series of numbers, which describe coordinates of points in three dimensional
  space. For example, (x,y,z,x,y,z,x,y,z).
Model View Matrix
  This is a special matrix, which describes the structure of an object
  regardless of WHERE that object is in 3D space. This matrix always remains
  constant, UNLESS the shape of the object changes. But if the object moves,
  this matrix will retain its values (the shape of the object).
Projection Matrix
  A matrix that describes the perspective and location of an object. For
  example, if a cube is rotating, then perspective will skew the shape that is
  drawn on the screen. The projection matrix is applied to the model view
  matrix to determine how to SKEW the original model view matrix.
GPU
  Graphics Processing Unit. This is the part of the computer that is performing
  calculations and creating the graphical components.
Shader
  A part of the code, written in low-level GLSL language. The GLSL language
  is low-level in that it happens on the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) instead
  of other processing units that handle other computational processes.
  Because of this division of labor, a shader can build complex 3D
  animations without slowing down other processes that happen at the same time.
Vertex Shader
  A part of the code, written in low-level GLSL language, responsible for
  defining points in three dimensional space. Simply define these points to
  create three dimensional objects. Vertex shader code is executed every time
  a point must be drawn, in three dimensional space, in order to determine
  WHERE that point is drawn.
Fragment Shader
  A part of the code, written in low-level GLSL language, responsible for
  'filling in' pixels with colors/textures. Any pixel that is NOT at a vertex
  must be given a color or texture. This type of 'filling in' is also called
  interpolation. Similar to how a vertex shader runs for every vertex, a
  fragment shader runs for every pixel.
Interpolation
  The process of coloring or texturizing points BETWEEN vertices, defined
  by the vertex shader. A fragment shader interpolates pixels by giving each
  one, between vertices, a color or texture, as defined by the fragment shader
  code.
Linear interpolation
  A fancy way of saying, 'filling in' a 3D shape. For example, if a pixel
  is shaded as RED, and two pixels to the right are shaded as blue, then
  LINEAR INTERPOLATION automatically shades the pixels (between red and blue)
  as a gradual approximation; from red, transition to purple, to blue.
  Even though you do not explicitly shade them with purple, the linear
  interpolation does that for you. In other words, it 'fills in' the in-between
  colors.
Program
  Combining a vertex with a fragment shader creates a code object called a
  program. A program can help draw fleshed out 3D shapes because it includes
  a vertex shader, which defines the shape and perspective; and
  a fragment shader, which defines the color and texture. Together, fragment
  and vertex shader code make a program.
Buffer
  One 'slide' image out of many possible 'slides'. You draw an image onto a
  buffer, saved in memory. A buffer holds the image results of the code that
  generated the image, in memory.
Frame Buffer
  A special type of buffer; the current buffer that's visible on screen.
